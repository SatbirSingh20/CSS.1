    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
<div class="cls">
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands fir Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li> <span id="id">Css is not neccesary</span> <b> <span id="id1"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> </b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li> <span id="id2">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. </span></li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<div class="cl">
<ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b> <span id="id1"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try yourself.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element, ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the elemnet.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
